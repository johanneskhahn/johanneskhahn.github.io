I am a research associate and doctoral candidate at the Analytics & Optimization Lab at University of Technology Nuremberg (UTN). Before following my supervisor Prof. Dr. Alexander Martin to UTN, I've had identical roles at the chair for Analytics & Mixed-integer Optimization at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU).

I am a Doctoral reseacher at the University of Technology Nuremberg. I did my undergrads at FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg and started my PhD there bofre moving to Nuremberg. Working Gas Networks Mechanism Design and Discrete Optimization. Supervisers are Alex Martin and Yiannis Giannakopoulos.

My research is primarily funded by the collaborative research center (CRC) SFB TRR-154, which is in its third and final phase. Sponsored by the German Research Foundation (DFG), TRR-154 aims for developing methods to supply gas efficiently, i.e., for optimal gas network control. Sub-project A05, which I am involved in, treats the incorporation of machine learning algorithms in order to enhance standard mathematical optimization methods.
Research Interests
Working Gas Networks Mechanism Design and Discrete Optimization. Optimal auctions under gas network constraints.

I went to the Bonaventura Gymnasium (High School) in Dillingen, Bavaria, which is committed to musically promotion. Besides learning to play the piano I gained an early enjoyment of classical music. In this time I also joined the choir CHORios - a group of passionate young singers from baroque to contemporary music. Until today I am very connected to this choir and we already had some nice concerts and concert tours.
