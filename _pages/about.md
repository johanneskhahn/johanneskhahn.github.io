went to the Bonaventura Gymnasium (High School) in Dillingen, Bavaria, which is committed to musically promotion. Besides learning to play the piano I gained an early enjoyment of classical music. In this time I also joined the choir CHORios - a group of passionate young singers from baroque to contemporary music. Until today I am very connected to this choir and we already had some nice concerts and concert tours.
