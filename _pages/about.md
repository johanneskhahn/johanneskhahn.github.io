## Quick Info
I am a research associate and doctoral candidate at the [Analytics & Optimization Lab](https://www.utn.de/departments/department-liberal-arts-and-sciences/analytics-and-optimization-lab/ "UTN | AO Lab") at [University of Technology Nuremberg (UTN)](https://www.utn.de "UTN") and fortunate to be advised by [Alexander Martin](https://www.utn.de/person/prof-alexander-martin/ "Alexander Martin") (UTN) and [Yiannis Giannakopoulos](https://yiannisgiannakopoulos.com "Yiannis Giannakopoulos"). Previously I've had identical roles at the chair for [Analytics & Mixed-integer Optimization](https://www.datascience.nat.fau.eu/research/groups/amio/ "FAU | AMIO") at [Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU)](https://www.fau.de "FAU").

My research interests lie in the fields of Discrete Optimization and Algorithmic Game Theory, more concrete in the intersection of Mixed-Integer Programming and Optimal Auction Design. Thus far in my doctoral researches, I have primarily worked on topics in Auction Theory, investigating discrete single-parameter auctions via LP duality.

My research is primarily funded by the [German Research Foundation (DFG)](https://www.dfg.de/en "DFG") via the [Collaborative Research Center (CRC) SFB TRR-154](https://www.trr154.fau.de "SFB TRR-154"), which is in its third and final phase. TRR-154 aims for developing methods to supply gas efficiently, i.e., for optimal gas network control. Subproject B07, which I am involved in, aims to treat multiparameter auction problems on graph structures.
